# C Implementations of Neural Networks

This is meant to be a part of my studies in seeing whether
improving training speeds in CPU-bounded systems, where
resource is also limited is possible or not.

### Currently:
- [ ] Matrix impl
- [ ] Activation & Loss Functions impl
- [ ] MLP impl
- [ ] Autoencoder impl
- [ ] CNN impl

_Might add more as I go on and continue the research_
